                        If there is still general disgruntlement about the chosen destination, the Miracle of Marco Taylor may occur. 
                        This is done by the symbolic act of combining the body of Marco Taylor (initially a pebble)
                        with the blood of Marco Taylor (initially some port.)

                        and have a reasonable discussion about where they would like the next destination to be.
